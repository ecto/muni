# CAD Files

Mechanical design files for BVR.

## Structure

```
cad/
├── chassis/        # Main frame
├── mounts/         # Motor mounts, electronics mounts
├── tools/          # Tool-specific mechanical parts
└── exports/        # STEP files for manufacturing
```

## Software

Primary CAD: [TBD - Onshape/Fusion 360/SolidWorks]

## Export Guidelines

- Export STEP for manufacturing
- Export STL for 3D printing
- Keep file sizes reasonable (simplify for export if needed)
- Name files with revision: `motor_mount_v2.step`

  <h3>FAQ</h3>

  <p><strong>Is this fully autonomous?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Not yet. BVR is designed for teleoperation first, autonomy second. An operator controls the rover remotely via Xbox controller with live 360-degree video. The rover has safety systems (LiDAR-based obstacle detection) that will stop it automatically, but a human is always in the loop. We're building toward autonomy incrementally as the system earns trust.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How does teleoperation work?</strong></p>
  <p>
    The operator uses an Xbox controller connected to a web-based interface. Commands are sent over LTE to the rover, which streams back 360-degree H.265 video. Total latency is typically 100-250ms. The operator sees a live feed rendered as an immersive skybox, with telemetry overlays showing battery, speed, and mode.
  </p>

  <p><strong>What's the video latency like?</strong></p>
  <p>
    End-to-end latency (capture -> encode -> LTE uplink -> relay -> LTE downlink -> decode -> display) is typically 100-250ms. If latency exceeds 500ms, the system warns the operator and reduces max speed. If connection is lost for 250ms, the rover coasts to a safe stop.
  </p>

  <p><strong>What sensors does it have?</strong></p>
  <p>
    BVR uses a Livox Mid-360 LiDAR (360-degree x 59-deg FOV, 200k points/sec) for safety and mapping, plus an Insta360 X4 for 360-degree video. The LiDAR provides deterministic obstacle detection regardless of lighting - no ML in the safety path, just geometry.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How does safety work?</strong></p>
  <p>
    The LiDAR continuously scans for obstacles. If anything enters the 1.5m safety radius, the rover triggers an immediate E-stop - all motors go to zero, tools disabled. This is pure geometry, no machine learning, no uncertainty. At 1 m/s, the rover stops within 22cm of detecting an obstacle.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How long does the battery last?</strong></p>
  <p>
    bvr0 has a 48V 20Ah (~1kWh) battery lasting 2-3 hours of typical operation. bvr1 has 48V 40Ah (~2kWh) for approximately 4 hours of continuous clearing, with quick-swap battery packs for extended operation. When voltage drops below 42V, max speed is reduced and the operator is warned. At 39V (critical), the rover performs a safe stop and waits for recovery.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Can it operate in snow and bad weather?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Yes, that's what it's built for. The Livox Mid-360 uses 905nm wavelength which handles light to moderate snow well. Heavy blizzards will degrade sensing, so we don't recommend mapping in those conditions - but the rover can still operate safely under teleop control. The LiDAR measures the snow surface, not what's underneath, which is exactly what you want for plowing.
  </p>

  <p><strong>What tools are supported?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Tools are hot-swappable via CAN bus. Currently supported: snow auger, salt/sand spreader, plow blade. Coming soon: mower deck. Each tool has its own microcontroller (RP2040) that announces itself when connected - no configuration needed, just plug in and go.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Is everything open source?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Yes. All firmware, hardware designs, and documentation are available on <a href="https://github.com/ecto/muni">GitHub</a> under permissive licenses. You can build your own bvr0 for ~$5,000 in parts. We believe open source is the right way to build infrastructure that cities depend on.
  </p>

  <p><strong>What's the difference between bvr0 and bvr1?</strong></p>
  <p>
    bvr0 is our engineering prototype - hand-built from 2020 aluminum extrusion, ~40 hours to assemble, intended for R&D and early adopters who want to build their own. bvr1 is our production rover - precision-engineered chassis with sheet metal shell, pre-assembled in ~8 hours, designed for municipal deployment.
  </p>

  <p><strong>What's the difference between Depot options?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Self-hosted is free and runs on your own hardware via Docker Compose. The 10" Rack is a pre-assembled base station ($6,000) with everything pre-configured - just plug in power and Ethernet. Managed (coming 2026) is a fully hosted service with no hardware to maintain.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Do I need RTK GPS?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Not required for basic operation. RTK provides centimeter-accurate positioning for georeferenced mapping and future autonomous navigation. The 10" Rack includes an RTK base station. For self-hosted, you can add one for ~$390 or subscribe to an NTRIP network (~$50/month).
  </p>

  <p><strong>How do I get started?</strong></p>
  <p>
    For DIY builders: check out the <a href="https://github.com/ecto/muni/tree/main/bvr/docs/hardware">hardware docs</a> and BOM (~$5,000 in parts). For municipalities: <a href="mailto:info@muni.works?subject=Fleet%20inquiry">contact us</a> about a pilot program. We're actively looking for partners in Midwestern cities to deploy and iterate with.
  </p>

  <p><strong>What's the warranty?</strong></p>
  <p>
    bvr1: 1 year parts and labor. bvr0 DIY: 90 days parts only.<br />
    Software updates are free forever (open source). Spare parts ship within 48 hours. Extended warranty available.
  </p>

  <p><strong>What about support?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Email response: 24-48 hours. Package customers get same-day phone support. On-site service available (travel fees may apply).
  </p>

  <p><strong>What certifications do you have?</strong></p>
  <p>
    LTE modem is FCC certified. Full rover assembly certification pending - targeting UL for bvr1. E-stop is hardware (button on rover), software (operator interface), and automatic (connection loss).
  </p>

  <p><strong>How is data handled?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Self-hosted: telemetry stays on your infrastructure. Managed: encrypted in transit, no third-party sharing. You own your data.
  </p>

  <p><strong>What about liability and insurance?</strong></p>
  <p>
    We carry product liability insurance for manufacturing defects. Customers are responsible for their own operational liability coverage.
  </p>

  <p><strong>What's the total cost of ownership?</strong></p>

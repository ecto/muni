<div class="section-title">FAQ</div>
<pre>
<b>Is this fully autonomous?</b>
Not yet. BVR is designed for teleoperation first, autonomy second.
An operator controls the rover remotely via Xbox controller with
live 360-degree video. The rover has safety systems (LiDAR-based
obstacle detection) that will stop it automatically, but a human
is always in the loop.

<b>How does teleoperation work?</b>
The operator uses an Xbox controller connected to a web-based
interface. Commands are sent over LTE to the rover, which streams
back 360-degree H.265 video. Total latency is typically 100-250ms.

<b>What's the video latency like?</b>
End-to-end latency is typically 100-250ms. If latency exceeds
500ms, the system warns the operator and reduces max speed. If
connection is lost for 250ms, the rover coasts to a safe stop.

<b>What sensors does it have?</b>
Livox Mid-360 LiDAR (360° x 59° FOV, 200k pts/sec) for safety and
mapping, plus Insta360 X4 for 360-degree video. No ML in the
safety path, just geometry.

<b>How does safety work?</b>
The LiDAR continuously scans for obstacles. If anything enters the
1.5m safety radius, the rover triggers an immediate E-stop. This is
pure geometry, no ML. At 1 m/s, stops within 22cm of detection.

<b>How long does the battery last?</b>
bvr0: 48V 20Ah (~1kWh), 2-3 hours. bvr1: 48V 40Ah (~2kWh), 4+ hours
with quick-swap battery packs for extended operation.

<b>Can it operate in snow?</b>
Yes, that's what it's built for. The Livox Mid-360 uses 905nm
wavelength which handles light to moderate snow well. The LiDAR
measures the snow surface, not what's underneath.

<b>What tools are supported?</b>
Hot-swappable via CAN bus. Each tool has its own MCU that
announces itself when connected.
  ├─ Snow auger
  ├─ Salt/sand spreader
  ├─ Plow blade
  └─ Mower deck (coming soon)

<b>Is everything open source?</b>
Yes. All firmware, hardware designs, and documentation are on
<a href="https://github.com/ecto/muni">GitHub</a> under permissive licenses. Build your own for ~$5,000.

<b>What's the difference between bvr0 and bvr1?</b>
bvr0: engineering prototype, hand-built, ~40h assembly, for R&D.
bvr1: production rover, pre-assembled in ~8h, for deployment.

<b>Do I need RTK GPS?</b>
Not required for basic operation. RTK provides cm-accurate
positioning for georeferenced mapping and future autonomy.

<b>What's the warranty?</b>
bvr1: 1 year parts and labor. bvr0 DIY: 90 days parts only.
Software updates are free forever (open source).

<b>What's the total cost of ownership?</b>
LTE data ............ ~$30-50/month per rover
Electricity ......... ~$0.50/day per rover
Operator time ....... 1 operator per 10+ rovers
Maintenance ......... ~$500/year per rover
Expected lifespan ... 5+ years

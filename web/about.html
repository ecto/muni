<pre>We watched people (parents with strollers, elderly neighbors,
kids walking to school) forced into the street because there
was no safe path on the sidewalk. Sidewalks are public
infrastructure. They deserve the same attention we give to roads.

So we asked a simple question: why are we still clearing sidewalks
by hand? Why isn't there a better way? We're building that future
in the open, one rover at a time.

<b>muni</b> was founded in 2025 in Cleveland, Ohio. We're a small team
of engineers who believe public spaces should work for everyone.

  <div class="box-content">
<pre>We're looking for 3-5 municipal partners in the Midwest to deploy
bvr1 fleets in winter 2026. Pilot partners get:

  ├─ Discounted hardware pricing
  ├─ On-site deployment and training
  ├─ Direct engineering support
  └─ Input on product roadmap

Ideal partners: cities with 10-50 miles of sidewalk, existing
public works team, willingness to iterate. Also: university
robotics teams and research labs.
